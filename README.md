## A bit about me

Hello! Iâ€™m a Data Scientist on the Elections Tabulation & Research team at The Associated Press, based in Seattle, WA.
I employ statistical models to predict voter turnout for races in every locality tabulated by the AP.

I earned my master's degree in Statistics and Applied Probability, and my doctoral degree in Political Science from the University of California Santa Barbara in 2023. I completed my master's degree in Political Science in 2017 at Sabanci University. My undergraduate degree from Koc University is in International Relations. I also earned a second undergraduate degree in Philosophy. I like applying inferential and predictive statistical models to economic, political, and institutional data. I also have significant experience with data cleaning, data management, and statistical programming. I have experience teaching statistical methods, American politics, and comparative politics at University of California Santa Barbara and Sabanci University at the undergraduate level.
